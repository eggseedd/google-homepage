 Recreation of Google homepage using HTML and CSS

 A part of Smoljames coding roadmap.<br>
 Basically just trying to recreate the Google homepage
 just by using HTML and CSS. 80%-90% of the code is according
 the tutorial that Smoljames made, but i added little tweaks
 of my preference (added actual links, changed several component's style).
